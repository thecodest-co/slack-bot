Great to see you have joined our awesome team at The Codest!
I'm Cody, and I'm here as I only hang out with cool kids :cool-dodge:.

You probably wonder what else do I do? There you go:
- I'm a master networker, helping others to get to know each other :man-woman-girl-boy:
- I'm a lucky chipmunk as it's obvious every great team should have at least one chipmunk :chipmunk:
- I'm still a rookie, but learning new things damn fast! :congaparrot:
Enjoy your ride with us and remember to never stop being cool. :sunglasses:

Peace.:peace-out:`,
